Due to the time limit, I tried my best, but there is so much more that can be done for this task and it is not complete.

- Fee information has not been connected to the APIs and they are hardcoded in the config
- Much more tests can be added
- Environemnt variables should be added
- It should be dockerized
- Pipelines can be added
- For saving the state of a paid fee to track the weekly limit a simple service can be added
- ...
